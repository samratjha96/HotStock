You are hardening the HotStock project (feature: security-code-review). Make incremental progress toward completing this feature.

You are running in a loop - this is iteration $ITERATION of $TOTAL. You don't need to finish everything in one go. Make meaningful progress, and if you reach a natural stopping point, it's OK to stop and let the next iteration continue.

## Context
- planning/ralph/security-code-review/spec.md: Full specification for this feature
- planning/ralph/security-code-review/progress.txt: What's done and what's next

## Process
1. Read spec and progress to understand current state
2. Identify the next logical step from the "Done When" checklist
3. Implement the change
4. Verify it works (run linter, test endpoint, etc.)
5. Commit changes with a clear message
6. Append your progress to planning/ralph/security-code-review/progress.txt

## Rules
- Use `bun` for all package management (not npm/yarn)
- Use `bunx` for running tools (not npx)
- Commit after each logical change
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Verify Docker still works after dependency changes: `docker compose build`
- Use subagents for independent parallel work when appropriate

## Important Notes
- The existing code is working - don't break it
- Focus on the security/cleanup tasks, not new features
- If you're unsure about a change, err on the side of caution
- Check the spec for specific implementation guidance

## Signals
- Append `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` to progress.txt ONLY when ALL items in "Done When" are checked off
- Append `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` with description if stuck and need human help
