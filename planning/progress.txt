**Frontend:**
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS served by Hono
- Competition list and detail views
- Modals for creating competitions and joining
- Leaderboard with rank highlighting
- Edit pick functionality (when window open)

**Infrastructure:**
- Dockerfile using official Bun image
- docker-compose.yml with persistent volume for SQLite

**Verified Working:**
