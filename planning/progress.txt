### 2026-01-07 - Full MVP Implementation

Built complete working MVP with all core features:

**Backend:**
- Hono server with REST API endpoints
- SQLite database with competitions, participants, price_history tables
- Yahoo Finance integration with user-agent rotation and caching
- All API endpoints: create competition, join, update pick, leaderboard, refresh prices

**Frontend:**
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS served by Hono
- Competition list and detail views
- Modals for creating competitions and joining
- Leaderboard with rank highlighting
- Edit pick functionality (when window open)

**Infrastructure:**
- Dockerfile using official Bun image
- docker-compose.yml with persistent volume for SQLite

**Verified Working:**
- Server starts and responds to API calls
- Yahoo Finance price fetching works (tested with AAPL: $261.82)
- All CRUD operations for competitions and participants
- Pick window open/closed logic enforced

---

## MVP Checklist Status

- [x] Can create a competition with name and pick window dates
- [x] Participants can join by entering name and stock ticker
- [x] Picks are editable until lock date, then frozen (enforced)
- [x] Baseline price is stored when window closes (via refresh-prices endpoint)
- [x] Daily/manual price fetch updates all current prices
- [x] Leaderboard displays participants ranked by % gain
- [ ] Everything runs with `docker-compose up` (Docker daemon was not running to verify)

---

## Next Steps

- Verify Docker deployment works when Docker daemon is available
- Consider adding a cron-like mechanism for automatic daily price updates (optional enhancement)

---

## Notes

- Docker build could not be tested because Docker daemon wasn't running on the dev machine
- The MVP is functionally complete - all features work via `bun run index.ts`
