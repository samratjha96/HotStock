You are building stock-picker-madness. Make incremental progress toward a working application.

## Context Files
- planning/project-spec.md: Full project specification with requirements, data model, API endpoints, and external integration details
- planning/progress.txt: Log of what's been done and what's next

## Your Process (Every Iteration)

1. **Read Context**: Read planning/project-spec.md and planning/progress.txt to understand current state
2. **Identify Next Step**: Pick the next logical piece of work that builds toward MVP
3. **Implement**: Write the code. Keep it simple and readable.
4. **Verify**: Make sure your changes work (code compiles, server starts, feature functions)
5. **Commit**: Git commit with a clear message describing what you built
6. **Log Progress**: Append to planning/progress.txt what you completed and what should come next

## Development Rules

- Use `bun` for all package management and running TypeScript
- NO TESTS - focus on working features only
- Keep code simple and readable - avoid heavy libraries
- Commit after each working feature
- If you need to do independent tasks, use subagents to parallelize work

## Completion Signals

When the MVP is fully complete (all items in "MVP Done When" are checked):
- Append `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` to planning/progress.txt

If you're blocked and cannot proceed without human input:
- Append `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` followed by a description of what you need
- Examples: missing API key, unclear requirement, external service down

## MVP Checklist (from spec)

- [ ] Can create a competition with name and pick window dates
- [ ] Participants can join by entering name and stock ticker
- [ ] Picks are editable until lock date, then frozen (enforced)
- [ ] Baseline price is stored when window closes
- [ ] Daily/manual price fetch updates all current prices
- [ ] Leaderboard displays participants ranked by % gain
- [ ] Everything runs with `docker-compose up`

## Important Notes

- Read the Yahoo Finance API integration details in the spec carefully
- The frontend should be vanilla HTML/CSS/JS served by Hono
- SQLite database should be persisted via Docker volume
- Start with the backend/database foundation, then add frontend
