You are building a project. Make incremental progress toward a working application.

## Context Files
- project-spec.md: Full specification of what to build
- ralph-progress.txt: Log of what's been done and what's next

## Your Process

1. **Read context**: Start by reading project-spec.md and ralph-progress.txt to understand the current state
2. **Identify next step**: Pick the next logical piece of work that moves toward MVP
3. **Implement**: Write the code. Keep it simple and working.
4. **Verify**: Ensure the code compiles/runs. Use `bun run build` or `bun run dev` as appropriate.
5. **Commit**: Make a git commit with a clear message describing what was done
6. **Log progress**: Append to ralph-progress.txt what you completed and what the logical next step is

## Development Rules

- Use `bun` for all package management (bun install, bun add, bun run)
- NO TESTS - focus on working features only
- Keep code simple and readable
- Commit after each working feature
- Use subagents (Task tool) for independent parallel work when beneficial

## Completion Signals

When the MVP is fully complete (all checkboxes in project-spec.md done):
- Append `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` to ralph-progress.txt

If you get stuck and need human input:
- Append `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` followed by a description of what's blocking you to ralph-progress.txt

## Important Notes

- The goal is a WORKING application, not perfect code
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- If something is unclear in the spec, make a reasonable decision and document it
- Docker must work: `docker-compose up` should start the entire app
